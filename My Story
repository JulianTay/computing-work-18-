The year is 2153. Life in Singapore still looks similar to the one in 2020, when the virus brutally attacked us, but nobody bothered to do anything to stop it. There were no flying cars, no hoverboards, no floating islands, no iPhone 30 and no PS10, nothing people would have envisioned to exist by now. It still looks the same with the skyscrapers, cars on the roads, planes in the skies and ships in the water. Nothing new was created at all to help society as they were just obsessed with making money. Society remained the same like those plain old days. Humanity has peaked its technology.
 Anyway, I digress. I am just a young student named Percy and I am tasked to write how life is like in 2153. This is my weighted assessment and I must score well with this essay. I am supposed to be writing to a student of my age in 2020. That would be you, I suppose. 
 Let us start with the history of what happened in 2020. In 2019, the virus attacked Earth. In 2020, the brave citizens of 2020 were forced to battle the virus with masks and hand sanitisers. They fought the virus for 10 years. In 2030, they developed new medication that will rid the virus of the body immediately. They were given out for free and the virus was wiped out. However, that was not the end of trouble for the 21st century. In 2042, the World Internet War began. As a student in 2020, you might wonder how one can fight a war in the Internet. It was very possible. Information was being leaked everywhere with nobody knowing who did it. People started getting angry and suspicious of others. Many people hacked each other as a form of revenge and soon the countries had to disable the Internet.
People went to the old ways of having fun. Neighbours played chess and checkers in the corridors and little children played in the playgrounds and bouncy castles. Everything went well for a few months. Then, some people requested for the Internet to be restarted. The government agreed but put many firewalls in place. People then went back to using the Internet and were joyful of getting their 6G wifi back. There was peace for some decades.
In 2070, humans reached Mars. They discovered that there was a chance of living there as there was ice which could be melted to form water. Soon, they started to build buildings there and a few astronauts lived in Mars for a while. When they tested that it was suitable for living, they asked the world whether anybody wanted to live there. Certain millionaires did. They brought their families to live there and it succeeded. People were amazed and living in Mars became what most people dream of. With better technology, we sent another a probe in space with a higher speed. It travelled for a far distance, so far we could not even decipher where exactly it was.
From 2071 to 2100, people protested about climate change and they wanted the government to do something about it. The icebergs were melting, the polar bears were dying and the weather was just getting hotter and hotter. This was the first time in many decades that there was a major protest and violence in the streets of Singapore. There were also anti-protesters protesters, who protested that the government should stop the protesters, which I find pretty ironic but thankful that somenbody bothered to do something. Thus, the governments started recycling more stuff and banned many plastic products. Littering will now give you a month in jail. 
Fast forward to 10/01/2153, the date I was born. Now I can give you a more detailed explanation. I was born in an hospital, like how you did, except that we have better technology and many more scanners to scan my vitals and my mother's vitals. The birth was probably conducted the same way and soon I was in this world.
I lived a normal life, except that I loved history and it was my favourite subject. I loved watching old movies and exceptionally liked the movies in your time. Avengers Endgame? What a good show! Of course, your show was of low quality, it could be watched but was kinda blurred.
There were also some famous Singaporean stars from your time like Noah the soccer player who I also liked books. They are very ancient as most libraries were tore down and built into shopping centres and movie theatres. All books were online and were in soft copy. Music stayed about the same as your time. But after consulting some meme history, I realised that the old songs which were one generation before you were actually popular in yur time. I never understood a 'rickroll'. It was basically
